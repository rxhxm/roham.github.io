About Me
======
I am a senior undergraduate student at the University of California, San Diego, specializing in Data Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My work bridges the areas of machine learning, speech recognition, and data-driven analytics. I have collaborated with MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) and UC San Diego’s Adaptive Computing and Embedded Systems (ACES) Lab on various research projects in these fields. I am passionate about utilizing technology to enhance real-world applications, and I constantly seek new ways to leverage data science to drive innovation.

Research Interests
======
My research interests include machine learning for audio processing, adversarial attacks in deep learning, and data-driven marketing strategies. I focus on applying self-supervised learning techniques to improve speech models, adversarial robustness, and the development of scalable systems for AI applications.


Selected Research Projects
======
- Neural Codec Resynthesis: Collaborated with MIT’s CSAIL on improving audio resynthesis quality by tuning Transformer model hyperparameters. Achieved a 15% boost in quality using Residual Vector Quantization.
